Many websites and digital platforms lack the necessary features to be fully accessible to visually impaired users. This oversight leads to a significant exclusion of individuals from digital services, which are increasingly pivotal in everyday life.

### Solution
ByteSight addresses this issue by providing a suite of AI-powered tools that enable websites to become fully accessible with minimal effort from developers. Our technology uses machine learning to adapt and optimize digital content in real-time, providing audio descriptions, intelligent text scaling, and high-contrast visuals as needed by the user.

## Target Audience

ByteSight primarily serves web developers, digital marketers, and content creators who are required by law or ethics to ensure their digital content is accessible. Our solutions also directly benefit individuals with varying degrees of visual impairments, who are seeking easier and more effective ways to access digital content.

These technologies were selected for their scalability, reliability, and broad support for AI and machine learning applications.

## Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

ByteSight’s competitive advantage lies in our proprietary AI algorithms which adapt in real-time to user’s accessibility needs, a feature not extensively available in current market solutions.
